# What is CI/CD
`Continuous Integration(CI)` is a software practice that requires continuous committing codes to a shared repository

  When you commit code to your repository, you can continuously build and test the code to make sure that the commit does not introduce errors. Your test code can include linters(Which check style formmarting), security checks, code coverages, functional tests, and other custom checks.


  Building and testing your code requires server. You can build and test updates locally before pushing codes to repository, or you can use a `CI server` that checks for new code commits in a repository.

  Github offers CI workflow for a variety of languages and framework. Check the list of workflow under action tab in your repository.

`Continuous Deplyoment` is a strategy for software releases wherein any code that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users
